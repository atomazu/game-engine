# Playground: A small graphics framework (WIP)
> This project is in <u>very early</u> stages. And may not be up to date or stable at any moment in time.
## A fun place for learning and experimentation.
I've started to learn [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and making a small graphics framework in [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) seems like a great way to do this!

I might add [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) support later when I'm done with the core functionallity.
## Tech Stack
I'm using [glfw](https://www.glfw.org/) for window and graphics API context creation, [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) bindings and [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm) for math. The whole project is written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).

Only [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) compilation is tested, but I try to add cross platform support whenever I can.

I'm using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to manage building for this project.
